## [Heroku Deployment]( https://slackclonev.herokuapp.com/).


## Desired List of Features

Here are the features it should have:

- A list of Channels
- A list of Users
- Maintain state for the currently-selected Channel or User
- Click a Channel or User to select it
- Only one Channel or User can be selected at a time
- Each Channel and User has its own history of messages
- Generate some fake messages for each channel
- Show an input box at the bottom, only when a Channel or User is selected
- Typing in the input box and hitting ENTER should add that message to the selected Channel/User and clear the input.
